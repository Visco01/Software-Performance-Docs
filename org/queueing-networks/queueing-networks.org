#+title: Queueing Networks
#+SETUPFILE: /Users/visco/.config/doom/latex-standard-setup.org

When we model a complex system, it may be useful to combine different servers
each of which is equipped with its queue and discipline. *Queueing networks are
composed by several components* that give responses to the users and they are
configured for different purposes or reasons:
1) *Duplication of components* to improve scalability and reliability;
2) A set of *heterogeneous components* having different functionalities that
   interact one another.

* Typologies of queueing networks

** Open networks
Open networks are a generalization of the queueing system described in the
previous chapters: in fact, they are an open network with single station.

The main characteristics of these systems are:
- One or more arrival streams;
- One or more departure streams;
- The scalability is defined in terms of *Jobs/sec*;
- Each station in the queueing network can have arrivals coming from other
  stations;
- Having a Poisson (or whatever) arrival process *doesn't* imply that the
  incoming process of other stations is the same;
- We assume that the capacity of each queue is infinite.

*** Instability of open networks
Here's the definition:
#+begin_quote
*Instability of open networks*: An open queueing network is unstable if, for
 some initial state, the number of jobs in the network will, with positive
 probability, go to infinity as time $t\rightarrow\infty$.
#+end_quote

In a *stable* open queueing network, for any sub-network, *the total flow
incoming must be equal its throughput*.

** Closed networks
Closed queueing networks are characterised by a *fixed number of customers* that
move among the system’s stations. There is not any arrival stream or departure.

The main characteristics of these systems are:
- They are *always stable*;
- The users (or jobs) alternate a "thinking" and "submitting" phases;
- The scalability is defined in terms of *#users* that interact with the
  network;
- They are more testable and practical compared to open networks;
- Workload characterized by the number of jobs (level of multiprogramming).

*** Further characterization of closed systems
1) *Interactive systems*: obs have a thinking phase that is executed
   independently;
2) *Batch systems*: Thinking phase is null: jobs keep submitting without
   waiting. It can be seen as the *worst case scenario* of Interactive systems.

*** Classification in terms of Classes
1) *Single Class system*: users are all statistically equivalent;
2) *MultiClass systems*: users combined in different clusters, in which each
   cluster has the same probability.


* Analysis of Single Class Interactive Systems
- $R$ *= Response Time* of the submitted state;
- $Z$ *= Duration* of the thinking state;
- $T=Z+R$ represents the *System State*.

Moving to the averages and emphasizing the number of customers N:
$$\overline{T}(N)=\overline{Z}+\overline{R}(N)$$

By relying on the Little's Law, the *throughput* is defined as
$$X(N)=\frac{N}{\overline{T}(N)}$$

As a consequence, we can deduce that
$$\overline{R}(N)=\frac{N}{X(N)}-\overline{Z}$$

#+begin_quote
In contrast with open networks (in which the throughput must be equal to the sum
of the arrival rates), in closed queueing networks the *throughput depends both
on the service rates and on the system population*.

#+begin_quote
*Routing*: It describes the way the jobs or customers move among the stations of
 the network. A type of routing which is widely used in queueing networks is the
 *probabilistic routing*: whenever a customer leaves a certain station, it
 chooses among all the possible destinations (including the outside) in a
 probabilistic way. This statement can be summarized thinking to a *Markov
 Chain*.
#+end_quote

- $\overline{V}_{i}$ *= Relative Visit Ratio*. It is the expected number of
  visits that a job performs at station $Q_{i}$ for each visit performed at a
  reference station (i.e. the first station of the network). Clearly,
  $\overline{V}_{1}=1$.

  Given a probabilistic routing, we can obtain $\overline{V}_{i}$:
  $$e_{i}=\lambda_{i}+\sum_{j=1}^Ke_{j}p_{ij}$$

  Where:
  - $e_{i}$ is the throughput of station $Q_{i}$;
  - $\lambda_{i}$ is the incoming stream rate from the outside for station
    $Q_{i}$.

  Then, $$\overline{V}_{i}=\frac{e_{i}}{e_{1}}$$

  Given these results, we state:
  #+begin_quote
  *Forced flow law*: For each queueing station of a network with $K$ stations
  and station 1 as reference station, we have: $$X_{i}=\overline{V}_{i}X_{1}$$.
  #+end_quote

- $\overline{D}_{i}$ *= Service Demand*. It represents the *total amount of
  service required by a customer to each station* for each visit it does at the
  reference station.

  It is important because it takes into account both the speed of a component and
  the frequency that this is used.

  It can be defined as:
  $$\overline{D}_{i}=\overline{V}_{i}\frac{1}{\mu_{i}}$$

  where $\frac{1}{\mu_{i}}$ is the average service time at station $i$ for each visit.

  Finally, we can define the
  #+begin_quote
*Bottleneck Law*: the utilization of a queue is related to the throughput of the
 reference station and the service demand.
 $$\rho_{i}=X_{1}\frac{X_{i}}{\mu_{i}}=X_{1}\overline{D}_{i}$$

* Burke's Theorem
Considering a tandem of *M/M/1* and *?/M/1* queues, Can we characterise the
stochastic process of the arrivals at the second queue? (i.e. Is it still a
Poisson process? Is it independent of the arrival process?).

#+begin_quote
*Burke's Theorem*: In steady-state ($t\rightarrow\infty$) the *departure process
 of a M/M/m queue* is:
1) A Poisson process;
2) With intensity equal to $\lambda$;
3) At any given time, the number of jobs in the system is independent of the
   departure process from the the first queue prior to that time
#+end_quote

Answering the questions provided above, the second queue behaves exactly *as an
isolated M/M/m queue*, and the performance indices can be derived as if the
queues were isolated.

* Jackson's Networks
This architecture allows for any *number of servers*, each with *its own
(unbounded) queue*, and *probabilistic routing between the servers*. The
architecture allows for cycles in the network and is very useful in modeling
packet-routing computer networks or networks of manufacturing stations.

** Characteristics
- $N$ queues interconnected;
- Open systems
  1) Independent Poisson arrivals with rate $\lambda_{i}$ at station $i$;
  2) Departures from some queues.
- Probabilistic routing between the queues
  1) Given a job serviced in station $i$, the probability of being sent to station $j$ is $p_{ij}$;
  2) With probability $p_{i0}$ the job leaves the system;
  3) *Cycles are allowed*;
  4) $\sum_{j=0}^Np_{ij}=1$
- $?/M/c$ queues;
- Due to the cycles, *arrival processes are not Poissons*.
  [[../../resources/jackson-network.png]]

The *response time of a job* is defined as the time from when the job arrives to the network until it leaves the network, including possibly visiting the same server or different servers multiple times.

** Arrival rate at each station
Assuming the stability condition on each station, we can compute the arrival rate $e_{i}$ for each of them through the *traffic equations*.
$$e_{i}=\sum_{j=1}^{N}e_{j}p_{ij}+\lambda_{i}$$

** The Jackson's theorem
#+begin_quote
Let $n=(n_{1}, ..., n_{N})$ be the state of the model, where $n_{i}$ is the number of jobs at station $i$.

The steady-state distribution $\pi(n)$ can be computed:
$$\pi(n)=\prod_{i=1}^{N}\pi_{i}(n_{i})$$

where $\pi_{i}(n_{i})$ is the teady-state distribution of station i *as if* it is subject to a Poisson arrival process with intensity $e_{i}$.

The network is stable *if and only if* each station considered in isolation is stable.
#+end_quote

* Burke's VS Jackson's theorems
1) *Burke’s* theorem states that the arrival process at the second queue is a Poisson process independent from the arrival process at the first queue.
2) *Jackson’s* theorem states that the steady-state distribution does not change if we replace the arrival processes at the queues with independent Poisson processes.
